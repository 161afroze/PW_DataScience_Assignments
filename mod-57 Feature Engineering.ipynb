Especially beneficial for datasets with numerous categories, one-hot encoding assigns each unique value its binary dimension, maintaining information integrity without introducing hierarchy. In restaurant reviews, one-hot encoding accurately represents meal types without implying any order, making it ideal for preserving categorical distinctions in machine learning models."
